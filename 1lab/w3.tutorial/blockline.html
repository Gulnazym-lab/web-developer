<!--
    A block-level element always starts on a new line, and the browsers automatically add some space (a margin) before and after the element.
    A block-level element always takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).
-->
<!--Here are the block-level elements in HTML:-->
<address><article><aside><blockquote><canvas><dd><div><dl><dt><fieldset><figcaption><figure><footer><form><h1>-<h6><header><hr><li><main><nav><noscript><ol><p><pre><section><table><tfoot><ul><video>

<!--
An inline element does not start on a new line.
An inline element only takes up as much width as necessary.
